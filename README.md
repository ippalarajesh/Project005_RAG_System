# **RAG System (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines document retrieval and language generation to provide more relevant, context-aware responses. The core components of this system are:

    LlamaIndex: For managing and indexing documents.
    ChromaDB: For efficient, embedding-based document retrieval.
    ChatGPT-4.0: For generating coherent responses based on retrieved documents.
    Evaluation Frameworks: DeepEval, Ragas, TrueLens, and Galileo for assessing system performance.

The system is designed to scale in production environments, integrating tools like Docker and Kubernetes for deployment, and it follows best practices for monitoring, logging, and maintenance.

## **Installation**

Follow these steps to get the RAG system up and running on your local machine.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+
    Virtual environment (venv)
    Docker (if using containerized deployment)


## **Setting Up the Environment**

1.Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-system.git
cd rag-system
```




## 2.Create and activate a virtual environment:
```python
python -m venv venv
# On Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

3.Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4.Create a .env file in the root directory of the project to store sensitive configurations such as API keys. See the example .env file section below.

5.Run the system:
```bash
python rag_system/main.py
```

## **System Overview**
# **1. Ingestion Pipeline:**

    The ingestion pipeline processes and indexes documents using LlamaIndex and stores the vector embeddings in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval.
    It supports various data sources such as web scraping, databases, or CSV files.
    Preprocessing is performed to clean and normalize text data before embedding.

# **2. RAG Pipeline:**

    The RAG pipeline consists of a retrieval phase (using ChromaDB) and a generation phase (using ChatGPT-4.0).
    The system retrieves the most relevant documents from ChromaDB based on the query, and then generates a response using the context from those documents.

# **3. Evaluation Framework:**

    We use several evaluation frameworks such as DeepEval, Ragas, TrueLens, and Galileo to assess the quality of generated responses, document relevance, and system performance.


    _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### **Usage**
# **Ingestion Pipeline**

The ingestion pipeline is responsible for preprocessing and ingesting large-scale documents into **LlamaIndex** and **ChromaDB**. This includes:

    Text cleaning (removing noise, special characters).
    Text embedding using OpenAI models or any other embedding models.
    Storing embeddings in ChromaDB.

To ingest documents:
```bash
python ingestion/ingestion_pipeline.py --source <path-to-documents>
```

# **RAG Pipeline**

The RAG pipeline first retrieves relevant documents from ChromaDB based on the user query and then uses ChatGPT-4.0 for generating responses.

To query the system:
```bash
python rag_pipeline/rag_pipeline.py --query "<your query here>"
```


# **Evaluation Framework**

To evaluate the system's performance, we use multiple frameworks:

    **DeepEval:** For evaluating the relevance and quality of generated responses.
    **Ragas:** To assess the overall system performance.
    **TrueLens and Galileo:** For fine-grained evaluations based on various metrics.

To run the evaluation:
```bash
python evaluation/evaluator.py --metrics deep_eval,ragas
```


# **Configuration**

The configuration for the system is managed in the config/config.json file. This file includes paths for document storage, ChromaDB settings, API keys for ChatGPT-4.0, and logging settings.

You can also configure sensitive information such as API keys using the .env file in the root directory of the project.

# Example of .env:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
LLAMA_INDEX_PATH=/path/to/llama_index
CHROMA_DB_PATH=/path/to/chroma_db
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

# **Deployment**

To deploy the RAG system in a production environment:

    **Docker:** The system can be containerized using Docker for easy deployment. The Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files are included in the project.

    **Kubernetes:** Use Kubernetes to scale the application horizontally or vertically based on load. You can deploy this system on a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

    **Cloud Deployment:** You can set up cloud infrastructure using services like AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine, or Azure Virtual Machines for production deployment.

```bash
docker build -t rag-system .
docker run -p 8080:8080 rag-system
```

# **monitoring & Logging**

To monitor the system and log interactions:

    The system uses a logging configuration stored in the config/config.json file.
    Logs are saved in logs/system.log, and the log level is adjustable (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).

For production systems, we recommend integrating Prometheus or Grafana for real-time monitoring.

# **Scaling**

To scale the system effectively in production:

    Horizontal scaling: Use multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer.
    Vertical scaling: Increase the resources (CPU, memory) for your server instances based on load.
    Containerization: Use Docker and Kubernetes to manage scalability and orchestration.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# **Best Practices**

    **Configuration management:** Use environment variables (.env) to manage sensitive data such as API keys and database paths.
    **Error handling and logging:** Implement robust error handling and comprehensive logging to monitor the system in real-time.
    **Modular architecture:** Keep the system modular by separating ingestion, RAG pipeline, evaluation, and deployment into distinct components.
    **Test and validate:** Ensure thorough testing and validation using the evaluation frameworks to measure response quality, document relevance, and system performance.
